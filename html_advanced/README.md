# ALU Web Development Project - HTML Advanced

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a **webpage structure from scratch** based on a Figma design file. The primary goal is to build a **pure semantic HTML** structure that follows the provided design without adding any CSS or styling at this stage.

### Key Features:
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to ensure accessible and maintainable code.
- Well-structured content that mirrors the designer's vision.
- Placeholder text and images where necessary to represent final content.
